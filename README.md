== Docker-heroku project annotations == 

== Introduction ==

The goal of the project is: 
	Given an app name and release version
	Grab the slug blob
	Unpack
	Map the unpacked slug to a /app inside a container
	Run the container with the commands of a specified process type
	
== Summary ==

- Project entirely in Go

- Using slug API V3

- Only external dependencies are docker and go-dockerclient 
	- (I'm using my own fork because of some fixes needed to work with latest Docker version)

- Go dockerclient lib has some issues, use internal Docker 
	- i.e: docker.Config and docker.HostConfig which are tricky to figure.


== Problems and what I learned == 

- Slugs and Releases API where a little tricky to figure how to use version 3 
	- "Accept: application/vnc.heroku+json; version=3"

- Go archive/tar and compress/gzip library

- Using the go-dockerclient to mount volumes is kind of a hack due to the internal structs of docker
	volumes := make(map[string]struct{})
	volumes["/app"] = struct{}{}
	.
	.
	.
	err = dClient.StartContainer(container.ID, &docker.HostConfig{Binds: []string{cwd + "/app:/app"}})

- Still prefered go-dockerclient because it can communicate with the default unix socket at /var/run/docker.sock
	- Tried to avoid any docker configuration tweak like listening on tcp port instead of unix domain

- Used a runtime image based on my own project (github.com/rsampaio/dockstep)
	- Basically a dockerfile that install the build deps and clone all buildpacks
	- Could be generated by cedar.sh stack-image 

== Things to improve ==

- Maybe a pre-made image on the docker index on heroku namespace would be nice
	- This image could be built by cedar.sh (or a variation like cedar_docker.sh)

- A progress bar or progress indication while downloading the slug 
	- The slug size is already listed on the API
